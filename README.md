# Cifar-10-Image-Classification
Implemented the basic algorithms to extract information from an image using SIFT and SURF descriptors for Bag of Visual Words (BoVW) and Vector of Locally Aggregated Descriptors (VLAD) representations. Compared the results against the deep learning model VGG16 on the Cifar 10 data-set. The CNN model registered an accuracy of 86% after tuning several parameters.
